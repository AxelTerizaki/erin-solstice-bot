# Contributing

This project uses Typescript and ESLint. Thesee should be installed when you do a `yarn install` but you should use an IDE that supports these for better use, like Visual Studio Code.

All commits should be in english. Issues can be in french or english.

Commits should use the [gitmoji](gitmoji.dev) emojis for better clarity. You can find a gitmoji plugin for Visual Studio Code, for example, if you're using it to manage your repository.

Remember to use `[skip-ci]` in your commit message if you don't want to trigger the CI pipeline (for example when making modifications to readme and such.)
